#        Skylist allows EMS organizations to create medical checklists with interactive elements such as drug-dose calculators, text-to-speech procedure reminder alarms, and clinical decision making algorithms. The Outstafford team took this idea from a literal "napkin-sketch" into a fully-fledged enterprise level software package which is being deployed in the real world to save lives.
